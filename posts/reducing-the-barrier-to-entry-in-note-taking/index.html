<p>One of my biggest challenges to accomplishing something is the barrier to
entry. Starting a project, exercising, and even writing this blog post take
genuine effort for me to do. After realizing this as one of my biggest
obstacles to getting things done, I&rsquo;ve dedicated quite a few cycles of my time
toward figuring out ways to reduce the initial friction. For the case of taking
notes, this involved both providing a quick way to get started as well as a
comfortable environment to write notes.</p>

<p>For me, the speed aspect revolved around having a simple interface to launch
new notes and resume existing ones. Given that I often find myself in a
terminal during work, my focus was on using a quick command like
<code>notes blogpost</code> to start or resume a blog post.</p>

<p>For comfort, I sought to use vim to edit my notes. I use it for my daily
editing and prefer having the familiar modes of editing compared to launching a
plain text editor. This meant that a command like <code>notes blogpost</code> should open
vim to allow me to create/edit a file and exit in the same manner as I would
any vim file.</p>

<h2 id="the-solution">The Solution</h2>

<p>Enter the zsh function: notes. I use zsh as my shell purely out of a desire for
some more robust completion, file renaming, and prompt tweaking. Rather than
creating a separate program that would need to be installed and added to my path
on every computer I use, I decided that creating a function to be exposed by my
shell would be the simplest way to have the functionality I wanted.</p>

<p>The function needed to do two things: provide a standard place to store my note
files and open those files using vim. To do this, I decided that my default
location for my notes would be a hidden directory called <em>.notes</em> within my
home directory. Within that directory, each note file would have the markdown
extension of <em>.md</em>. The function itself could be provided with the name of the
note file such as <em>blogpost</em> and it would in turn open the corresponding
markdown file (e.g. <em>blogpost.md</em>).</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#e5e5e5;background-color:#000;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">notes() {
  local base_path=&#34;$HOME/.notes&#34;
  mkdir -p &#34;$base_path&#34;

  local note_file=&#34;$1.md&#34;
  local note_path=&#34;$base_path/$note_file&#34;

  $EDITOR &#34;$note_path&#34;
}</pre></div>
<p>The above would create the <em>.notes</em> directory if it did not exist, convert the
provided argument into a file name, and then open the file using my editor,
which was configured earlier in my <em>.zshrc</em> file as <code>export EDITOR=&quot;nvim&quot;</code>.</p>

<p>From here, I could quickly jump into vim without the need to navigate to a
note-taking directory or specify the entire file including the extension. If I
wanted to work on <em>post-1</em>, I could type <code>notes post-1</code> to open the file.</p>

<h2 id="the-aftermath">The Aftermath</h2>

<p>Since creating that tiny function, I began tweaking and expanding what it can
do. This ranged from filling in a new file with a default header to being able
to list existing notes. Given its complexity, I&rsquo;ve decided to extract the
function and move it to its own zsh plugin, which you can find at
