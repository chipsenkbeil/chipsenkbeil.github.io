The goal of this assignment was to demonstrate a basic understanding of
multiple data structures being used together to provided different methods of
traversing data. In this implementation, a quadtree and a binary search tree
were used.

Please note that the code provided is an exact copy of my assignment as
submitted in the class and has a flaw in the quadtree implementation. This was
corrected in project 4, which used this project.
