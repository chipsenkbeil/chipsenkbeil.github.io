The goal of this assignment was to demonstrate an understanding of how
different programming concepts such as the use of data structures for specific
situations as well as sorting implementations and how to adapt them for
different cases.

The project required use of the previous three projects to implement an
externally-sorted set of geographic point data along with an externally-stored
quadtree, all of which was maintained using an LRU buffer.

This project contains fixes to my previous implementations of the buffer and
quadtree, both of which had minor issues in implementation that caused specific
cases to not be executed correctly.
