The goal of this assignment was to demonstrate a basic understanding of memory
management within a buffer. In the case of this assignment, least recently used
(LRU) was the implementation for swapping blocks.

Please note that the code provided is an exact copy of my assignment as
submitted in the class and has a flaw in the merging of blocks. This was
corrected in project 4, which reused this project.
