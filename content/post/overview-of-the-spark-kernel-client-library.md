In this third and final part of the Spark Kernel series (part 1, part 2), we
will focus on the client library, a Scala-based library used to interface with
the Spark Kernel. This library enables Scala applications to quickly
communicate with a Spark Kernel without needing to understand ZeroMQ or the
IPython message protocol. Furthermore, using the client library, Scala
applications are able to treat the Spark Kernel as a remote service, meaning
that they can run separately from a Spark cluster and use the kernel as a
remote connection into the cluster.
