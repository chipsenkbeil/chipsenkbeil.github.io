### Notes for self ###

Plan is to have a main page with a grid of pictures for each section
of my site. Should not show the section UNTIL I have content for it.

Mousing over one of the sections provides an alpha filter on top and a
description of the section.

1. Blog
2. Hardware projects
3. Game projects
4. Resume
5. Work projects
6. Developer (utility) projects
7. Contact information
8. Art projects
9. Music projects
10. Foreign language projects

Need a picture per section.

For blog, use one of the themes from Hugo.

For projects, switch to a new grid with picture per project.

For resume, see if there is a way to convert LaTeX into web page or
just provide download links.

For contact information, link to social like LinkedIn, Google Plus, and
Github.
