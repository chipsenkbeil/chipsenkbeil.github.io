      <description>Writing blog posts is hard, at least for me. What is a good topic to discuss? When can I find the time to write the content? How can I stay focused long enough to finish a post? How do I understand if the post was a hit?
Interestingly enough, the challenges posed by those questions share similarities with those that I&amp;rsquo;ve faced as a Solutions Engineer, and it&amp;rsquo;s these challenges and how I&amp;rsquo;ve approached tackling them that I want to discuss now.</description>
