      <description>As a reminder, you can check out my overview post if you&amp;rsquo;re curious about why and in what ways I started using GPG and Yubikey. If you haven&amp;rsquo;t set up your GPG keys yet, I also talk about a simple flow in my second post.
Today, we&amp;rsquo;re going specifically into using GPG for authentication for SSHing into remote servers and associating with Github.

If you haven&amp;rsquo;t set up your GPG keys yet, I also talk about a simple flow in my second post. Finally, the email signing section expects you to have already set up encryption, so you should really check out my third post regarding encryption setup with neomutt.</description>

      <description>If you haven&amp;rsquo;t read my overview post, feel free to check it out to get an idea of why and how I started using GPG and Yubikey.
Today we&amp;rsquo;ll be diving into how to set up a new master GPG key and configure it for use with the pass utility.

      <description>Today is going to be the first in a series of posts I want to write about applying GPG and YubiKey. I won&amp;rsquo;t pretend that I am an expert on either GPG or Yubikey. Instead, I&amp;rsquo;ll be focusing on how I have been using GPG and a variety of Yubikey devices to enhance my computer experience.
In this post, I&amp;rsquo;m going to dive into GPG and YubiKey at a high level and explain what they are to my understanding and how I am using them.</description>
