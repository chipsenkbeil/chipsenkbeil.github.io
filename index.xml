      <description>If you haven&amp;rsquo;t read my overview post, feel free to check it out to get an idea of why and how I started using GPG and Yubikey.
Today we&amp;rsquo;ll be diving into how to set up a new master GPG key and configure it for use with the pass utility.
Setting up a primary GPG key Although I knew I had an old key floating around from previous use, I wanted to start from scratch.</description>

      <title>Linux Virtual Monitors with xrandr</title>
      <link>https://chipsenkbeil.com/notes/linux-virtual-monitors-with-xrandr/</link>

      <guid>https://chipsenkbeil.com/notes/linux-virtual-monitors-with-xrandr/</guid>
      <description>I recently learned that you can configure virtual monitors with xrandr. There are two different ways to use this: treat multiple physical monitors as one giant virtual monitor or treat one physical monitor as multiple virtual monitors.
Why do I want to do this? My primary interest here is to split a super widescreen monitor like the Dell 49&amp;rdquo; UltraSharp Curved Monitor (U4919DW) as multiple separate displays. I like the way that dwm breaks up monitors into multiple spaces and when I have two or three separate monitors I normally use a center monitor for focused work with the side monitors containing music, calendar, and chat.</description>

      <description>Today is going to be the first in a series of posts I want to write about applying GPG and YubiKey. I won&amp;rsquo;t pretend that I am an expert on either GPG or Yubikey. Instead, I&amp;rsquo;ll be focusing on how I have been using GPG and a variety of Yubikey devices to enhance my computer experience.
In this post, I&amp;rsquo;m going to dive into GPG and YubiKey at a high level and explain what they are to my understanding and how I am using them.</description>

      <description>The main changes need to occur in /etc/dhcpcd.conf.
Find Interface Name Before editing that file, we need to look up our ethernet interface name. This used to be something easy like eth0, but Debian appears to have changed interface names. Run ifconfig to see Debian&amp;rsquo;s current interfaces. With the Raspberry Pi 3 B+, there will also be a wifi interface shown as below:

      <description>Writing blog posts is hard, at least for me. What is a good topic to discuss? When can I find the time to write the content? How can I stay focused long enough to finish a post? How do I understand if the post was a hit?
Interestingly enough, the challenges posed by those questions share similarities with those that I&amp;rsquo;ve faced as a Solutions Engineer, and it&amp;rsquo;s these challenges and how I&amp;rsquo;ve approached tackling them that I want to discuss now.</description>

      <title>Breaking Down the Zsh Notes Function</title>

      <description>Earlier, I discussed my need to have method to jot down notes quickly and comfortably on a computer. I wanted the setup to be as painless as possible while also giving me the flexibility I desired to extend the note-taking method.
Being a lightweight user of zsh - not leveraging many plugins or additional functionality - I decided to explore writing a zsh function to be exposed in my shell.</description>

      <title>Reducing the Barrier to Entry in Note Taking</title>

      <description>One of my biggest challenges to accomplishing something is the barrier to entry. Starting a project, exercising, and even writing this blog post take genuine effort for me to do. After realizing this as one of my biggest obstacles to getting things done, I&amp;rsquo;ve dedicated quite a few cycles of my time toward figuring out ways to reduce the initial friction. For the case of taking notes, this involved both providing a quick way to get started as well as a comfortable environment to write notes.</description>

Supporting port 80 &amp;amp; 443 By default, proxmox looks for traffic only on port 8006. Based on my readings online, forcefully changing the port - which is now hardcoded - can cause a lot of problems. Instead, the most recent and successful recommendation has been to use nginx to redirect traffic on port 80 and 443 to port 8006.</description>

      <description>Couple of notes about searching on Github that have proven to be quite useful:
 You can include/exclude specific files using the filename property in a search.
The following searches for content &amp;ldquo;some content&amp;rdquo; only in .config files.
some content filename:.config The following searches for content &amp;ldquo;some content&amp;rdquo; in all files but .config files.
some content -filename:.config You can include/exclude specific users and organizations in a search. This is handy when I&amp;rsquo;m trying to judge how much use a library of mine is getting in the open source community while avoiding my own projects.</description>

      <title>Toggle Dvorak</title>

      <description>In my ArchLinux setup with XMonad, I&amp;rsquo;ve found myself wanting to swap between QWERTY and Dvorak keyboard layouts when practicing Dvorak. While my Kinesis Advantage keyboard allows me to swap layouts at the hardware level (I&amp;rsquo;m assuming by simulating Dvorak on top of Qwerty), I also found a keyboard-agnostic way to do this.
Configuring Keypress Toggle For X11, create the following configuration at /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/00-keyboard.conf:

      <title>Fix for XMonad with XMobar</title>
      <link>https://chipsenkbeil.com/notes/fix-for-xmonad-with-xmobar/</link>

      <guid>https://chipsenkbeil.com/notes/fix-for-xmonad-with-xmobar/</guid>
      <description>When I updated XMonad late last year (2015), I noticed a bug where any application that I opened on my first workspace would cover XMobar.
E.g. Opening a terminal or Vivaldi took up the entire screen. The solution I found was, conveniently, located in a post on the ArchLinux forum.
Essentially, you just need to add a handleEventHook with docksEventHook and handleEventHook defaultConfig.
-- My overall config that is used elsewhere myConfig = defaultConfig { manageHook = manageDocks &amp;lt;+&amp;gt; manageHook defaultConfig , layoutHook = avoidStruts $ layoutHook defaultConfig , handleEventHook = mconcat [ docksEventHook , handleEventHook defaultConfig ] , startupHook = setWMName &amp;#34;LG3D&amp;#34; , terminal = &amp;#34;urxvtcd&amp;#34; , modMask = mod1Mask , borderWidth = 1 , focusedBorderColor = &amp;#34;blue&amp;#34; }</description>

      <title>CSS Masonry Layout Attempts</title>

      <description>I spent two days investigating this and could not find a solution that worked. Eventually, I gave up and added the Masonry Javascript library. My two attempts were as follows:
Using CSS Columns CSS Columns enabled an easy, powerful way to spread page summaries across multiple columns. Furthermore, you can prevent page summaries from being broken up in the middle by using column-break-inside: avoid;. However, I had no way to order the page summaries dynamically such that the most recent summaries were at the top (from left to right) and older summaries were found further down.</description>

      <title>tmux with XMonad Bindings</title>

      <description>The Reason I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing around with tmux a lot lately and have come to like it quite a lot for the panes and windows - something I used quite a lot with my XMonad setup on my old Fujitsu laptop. The panes act as my individual terminals with which I can write code, read documentation, chat on IRC (using weechat or irssi), play music, etc. In other words, I do quite a lot from within terminals and being able to split up a terminal into panes (like XMonad launching tiled terminals) is quite nice.</description>

      <title>Using blkid to get device information</title>

      <description>Quite often, I find myself needing to remind myself of devices connected to my computer so that I know what to type for the pmount program, which is really handy to have! The program [i]blkid[/i] is capable of doing this; however, I didn&amp;rsquo;t care for the default output and found myself using this format:
blkid -o list -c /dev/null What this does is tell the program to output the information in a user-friendly list of devices through &amp;lsquo;-o list&amp;rsquo; and not report previous devices using &amp;lsquo;-c /dev/null.</description>
